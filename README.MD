*by **Tony Boswell***

## Preface
Sorry, I'm a dog person and so I made mine into pictures of my dog, Rowdy, instead.

## Project Requirements for Cat Clicker Premium

### Visuals

-   The application should display

    -   a list of at least 5 cats, listed by name
    -   an area to display the selected cat
-   In the cat display area, the following should be displayed

    -   the cat's name
    -   a picture of the cat
    -   text showing the number of clicks
-   The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.

### Interaction

-   When a cat name is clicked in the list, the cat display area should update to show the data for the selected cat.
-   The number of clicks in the cat area should be unique to each cat, and should increment when the cat's picture is clicked.
